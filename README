NAME

    ClickHouse - Database driver for Clickhouse OLAP Database

VERSION

    Version 0.04

SYNOPSIS

    ClickHouse - perl interface to Clickhouse Database. My final goal is to
    create DBI compatible driver for ClickHouse, but for now it's
    standalone module.

    It's the first version and so module is EXPERIMENTAL. I can't guarantee
    API stability. More over, API will probably change and it will be soon.

    This module is a big rough on the edges, but I decided to release it on
    CPAN so people can start playing around with it.

EXAMPLE

        use ClickHouse;
    
        my $ch = ClickHouse->new(
            host     => $ENV{'CLICK_HOUSE_HOST'}
            port     => 8123,
            user     => 'Frodo'
            password => 'finger',
        );
    
        my $rows = $ch->select("SELECT id, field_one, field_two FROM some_table");
    
        for my $row (@$rows) {
            # Do something with your row
        }
    
        $ch->do("INSERT INTO some_table (id, field_one, field_two) VALUES",
            [1, "String value", 38962986],
            [2, "String value", 38962986],
        );

SUBROUTINES/METHODS

 new

    Create new connection object

 select

    Fetch data from table. It returns a reference to an array that contains
    one reference per row (similar to DBI::fetchall_arrayref).

 do

    Modify data inside the database. It's universal method for any queries,
    which modify data. So if you want to create, alter, detach or drop
    table or partition or insert data into table it's your guy.
